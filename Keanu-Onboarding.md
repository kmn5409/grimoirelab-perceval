	- Contributing to Perceval:
		- https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval/blob/master/docs/contributing.rst
	- Task: Explanation of how  you would bring a new data source into Perceval.  Possibly look at the specific ways that python dictionaries are developed and put into elastic search. A step by step guide to taking a new data source and implementing in Perceval. Maybe Mozilla or Apache. Mailing lists or source code repositories.  Implemented in Perceval ...
2. Enhance Perceval docs around importing data, putting in Elastic Search and Extracting .... You could use the datasets that you started with in your microtasks and document the steps you used in that case.
3. Setup Augur : https://github.com/OSSHealth/augur
4. Setup Augur to include a Perceval Elastic Search Connector: https://github.com/OSSHealth/augur/tree/master/ghdata contains current connectors and can be used as a template.
